I moved to Germany in February 2019.
Since then I work at [Tipster Service GmbH](https://tipster-service.de/) in Cologne.

Before coming to Germany, I developed a betting website platform with [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/), 
[React](https://reactjs.org/) and [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) for this company as a freelancer.

After coming to Germany, I developed an [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) application that provides communication
between hardware(cash acceptors, barcode readers, printers) and that betting website.

Later than, I developed a microservice infrastructure for the company's websites. All microservices are running in [docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers. Tech stack includes [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/), [redis](https://redis.io/), [GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/).

Since June 2020, I have started to work in the core team. I use C++, [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) and [WSL2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux) daily.

In the early years of my professional career in Turkey, I had a chance to get a lot of experience in financial services. I worked for
some of the biggest banks there. All these years, I used [JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and various kinds of 
[.NET Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP.NET) technologies. I even worked on projects written in
[Visual Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic).
